# song-popularity-analysis
*WIP*: This is a refactored repository of my original work for STAT 1361.

Business problem: SonicWave Productions is a growing company seeking to gain headway in the music industry. They have hired me as a Data Science Consultant to predict hte popularity of songs from rock, jazz, and pop genres. They provided me with a data set of 1200 observations across 19 variables that encompassed various song features like danceablility, explicit-ness, etc.
